I booted Ubuntu on the lab computers from a CD and
after running dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh,
I had to also install the openssh-server since I
already had the client.
When running ssh-keygen, I saved the key in /home/
ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa, the default location and was
prompted to enter a password which I did.
Then the terminal gave me a key fingerprint and
showed a randomart image.
Then I set up an account for the client side by doing
sudo useradd -d /home/collin/ -m collin
sudo passwrd collin
and entered in a password.
I made a .ssh directory for collin's user account
, and I changed its permissions with sudo chown -R collin .ssh and sudo chmod 700 .ssh.

Doing the client part, I did ssh-copy-id -i
shannon@10.97.85.162 and ssh-add. Then I
SSH'ed into the server and was able to run xterm
and have the GUI pop up on my computer.
