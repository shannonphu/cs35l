I git cloned the original diffutils repository into
another local directory. Then I checked-out v3.0 again
and made a new branch called quote from that point.
I applied my patch I made from the lab by doing
patch -p1 <../../quote-3.0-patch.txt. Each hunk of my
diff patch was successfully applied. I attempted to
use the Emacs Changelog by opening Emacs and doing
C-x 4 a which opened the Changelog for my current
diffutils directory. I entered a message and saved it.
Then I added the modified files to the stage area for
committing. I committed the changes with the command
git commit -F Changelog. I confirmed that the commit
was recorded by doing git log.

Then to generate a formatted patch, I ran git help
format-patch to check out what this command does and
how it is used. I ran:
git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt
I included the -1 option to only include the most
recent patch which was the one I made.

My partner was Elton Leong. When I ran my partner's patch,
I checkedout a new branch from v3.0 called partner. I
applied my partner's patch to it by doing git am partner_patch.
Then I had to rebuild the system by doing ./bootstrap, ./configure,
make, and make check.

When I ran make distdir, my ChangeLog file did not change.
