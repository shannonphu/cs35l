When I compared the performance between sfrob and sfrobu by
timing them, I got the following times:

Buffered time:
0.25user 0.02system 0:00.48elapsed 57%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 5452maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+1389minor)pagefaults 0swaps

Unbuffered time:
0.36user 5.11system 0:05.48elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 5444maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+1399minor)pagefaults 0swaps

We can obviously see that unbuffered I/O is much
slower than buffered.



When I had 3 lines, 2 comparisons were made. When I had about 10
lines, 25 comparisons were made. When I had about 40 lines, 170
comparisons were made. When 100 lines were input, about 570
comparisons were made. When 110 lines were input, 644
comparisons were made. For 167 lines, 1125 comparisons occured.
For 300 words, there were 2252 comparisons made. There seems
to be an accelerating increase in comparisons with respect
to the lines. So I estimate the function to be about N^2 / 20.

When I timed the shell script, I got:
0.02user 0.07system 0:00.50elapsed 19%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 6796maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+1994minor)pagefaults 0swaps

So we see that the shell script is much faster
than the unbuffered version I wrote, but a tiny bit
slower than the buffered version's in terms of
system calls made.
