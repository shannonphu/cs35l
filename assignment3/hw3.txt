Q1:
Removing case_long_iso_time_style was necessary. Since
that code section is part of a switch statement, it would
check for case "long_iso_time_style" and then start
executing the lines underneath, but since that syntax error
was placed underneath, it could cause some undefined behavior
as to how case_ would be interpreted. The code would still
execute until the break statement, but the syntax error for
"case_long_iso_time_style" may lead to unexpected behavior
although there probably won't be an input leading directly
to that case.

Q2:
There should not be an issue with the time and date format
in other locales. The part of the patch that changed the case
"locale_time_style" called a function called dcgettext. This
function looks up a translation of the current locale to
account for differences in locale.

Q3:
When randline.py is ran with /dev/null, an error occurs
stating that there is an index error in the list of lines
from the file. Since /dev/null is "empty", the list in
the program is empty and cannot be indexed.

Q4:
There is a syntax error in the statement saying "except
IOError as (errno, strerror)". This is improper Python3
syntax and to be compatible should be "except IOError as
err" instead.
