Lab:

1. man -k <keyword looking for>. I found this by doing man man and
finding that the option -k can be used for this.

2. cp is in /bin/cp and wc is in /usr/bin/wc. This was found by
using whereis.

3. Many files show up, when searching recursively through the root
directory. There are too many to list. The command I did was
find / -executable -name ?

4. /usr/bin/cc is a link to gcc. I found this by doing ls -l /usr/bin/cc.

5. chmod g-s means to remove the file's group members' permission to
access the owner's file. It turns off a setguid bit and restricts access
from the owner's file after that temporarily gave permission to group.I
found this by doing man chmod

6. -mtime. I found this by doing man find.

7. find -type d (find type of directory) -mtime 3
Using the above command, I got:

./Desktop/CS35L/assignment1/exer2.html~
./Desktop/CS35L/assignment1/ans1.txt~
./Desktop/CS35L/assignment1/key1.txt~
./Desktop/CS35L/assignment1/exer3.html~
./Desktop/CS35L/assignment1/exer2.diff
./Desktop/CS35L/assignment1/#exer1.html#
./Desktop/CS35L/assignment1/exer4.html
./Desktop/CS35L/assignment1/exer2.html
./Desktop/CS35L/assignment1/exer3.diff
./Desktop/CS35L/assignment1/exer3.html
./Desktop/CS35L/assignment1/exer4.html~
./Desktop/CS35L/assignment1/exer4.diff

8. whereis find
   find * /usr/bin/ | wc -l 
   (gets all files in usr/bin and returns count)
   find * /usr/bin -type l | wc -l
   (gets all symbolic links in usr/bin and returns count)

   There are 357 symbolic links in the same directory as find.
   
9. The oldest file is called "sgmlwhich" that was last made on
   Nov 17, 2000.
   This was found by doing ls -l /usr/bin/ --sort=time.

10. Locale gets its data from the local environment variable, LC_*.

11. When I looked up the documentation of Emacs, sort exists in
sort-lines, sort-paragraphs, sort-pages, sort-fields, sort-numeric-fields,
and sort-columns. 

12.
C-a: go to beginning of line
C-b: backspace 
C-c: exit recursive edit 
C-d: delete character in front of cursor
C-e: go to end of line
C-f: move cursor forward
C-g: quits current prefix command
C-h: help
C-i: tab
C-j: make new line
C-k: kill line
C-l: recenter
C-m: make new line
C-n: next line
C-o: make new line below
C-p: go to previous line
C-q: insert
C-r: search backwards
C-s: search forward
C-t: swap characters
C-u: universal argument
C-v: scroll up
C-w: cut
C-x: C-x prefix
C-y: yank, paste
C-z: suspend emacs

13. C-g can be pressed when the user is midway into a command that takes
multiple key strokes to accomplish but wants to quit mid-way. An example
is C-x C-s to save the Emacs file. C-x could be pressed, and then the user
could change their mind before pressing C-s and could thus cancel the C-x
by doing C-g to prevent any accidental commands.

14. Yank pastes text the user copied or cut into their clipboard.

15. Emacs dired command gives more files than ls -l does and
    shows more hidden files. To do this, I compared the output
    of ls -l and M-x dired for /usr/bin.
