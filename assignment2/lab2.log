Lab:

The first line translates all non-letter characters
into new lines. So A-Z and a-z will be preserved, but
all other characters will be replaced by a new line.

The second command prints only 1 new line if there are
supposed to be multiple consecutive new lines. The
previous command printed multiple new lines, once for
every non-alphabet character, but now only 1 new line
will print for any number of consecutive non-alphabetic
characters.

The third command does the second command's functions,
but also sorts each line alphabetically and by ASCII
code.

The fourth command does the above, but also removes the
repeated words that appear on the list.

The fifth command compares the sorted version of the
words in assign2.html with the content of file named
words. It only outputs column 1 which has the words
unique to assign2.html.

The sixth command does the same things as command 5,
but also suppresses teh second and third columns of
output.

To get the number of words "misspelled" when cross-
checking with hwords, we should do the command:
cat file.txt | tr 'A-Z\ ' 'a-z\n' | sort -u |
    comm -23 - hwords | sed '/^\s*$/d' | wc -l
This command lower-cases all letters and comverts
any spaces into new lines, sorts, then compares to
hwords. Then it prints out the number of words
that do not exist in hwords. When the above command
is run on the lab web page, it gets 523 misspelled
words. When run with the Hawaiian dictionary page's
HTML, it gets 590 "misspelled" words which are probably
the English words. When ran with hwords itself, it gets
0 mispelled words which is expected.

An example if a word that is mispelled as Hawaiian based
on my spell checker is the word "won" which is valid
English. As for a correct Hawaiian word that is invalid
in English, an example would be almost every word in hwords.
This includes hanai, nani, ame, pane, etc.

Homework:

sameln deals with files that have a space in between file
names, but does not deal with files that have a '-', '*',
etc in the front.
